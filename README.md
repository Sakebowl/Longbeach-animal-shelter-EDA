# Longbeach-animal-shelter-EDA

Final report with exploratory data analysis and regression models for the course Statistical programming in R.

In this report I analysed Long Beach Animal Shelter data available at:
https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2025/2025-03-04/readme.md

Long Beach Animal Shelter dataset contains various variables about animals taken into the shelter between years 2017 and 2024. These variables provide information about animal characteristics (animal type, color, intake condition, intake type, sex, sterilization status etc.), dates (date of birth, intake date, outcome date) and shelter related information (jurisdiction, longitude, latitude).

I investigated several of these variables in EDA, formulated research question and hypothesis. I investigated whether inclusion of contex/interventional variables improves predicting adoption compared to the model where only animal-focused, biological variables were included.
